🔧 Challenges Overcome

1. YAML Syntax Issues

Problem: YAML errors prevented CI execution

Solution: Rewrote a simplified YAML file and tested it incrementally


2. Username Identity Conflict

Problem: Conflict between personal name (Samir Baladi) and GitHub username (emerladcompass)

Solution: Clear separation between author identity and repository ownership


3. GitHub Push Conflict

Problem:
remote contains work that you do not have locally

Solution:
Used git pull --allow-unrelated-histories to reconcile histories
